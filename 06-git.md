# A gudder git

![](img/gitgud.jpg)

* Git is simple, the git-cli is not
* SourceTree, GitHub Desktop, GitKraken
* Git in VSCode is a good compromise but "gets in the way"
* Remember rule [#3](00-intro.md)!

## GitKraken

Pros:
* Awesome, but at a cost (literally) 🤑
* I really like *projects*
* The visual tree is amazing 🌈

Cons:
* Slow in big projects
* Forces you to use Profiles

## GitHub Desktop

Pros:
* Fast & Simple
* Made by GitHub ❤️
* No enterprise BS!

Cons:
* Lacks visual elements
* Issues with GitHub Enterprise

## *Git-cli enters the room*
* Native support in zsh
* How I organize projects
* Aliases
* GPG 🔐
