* The prefix! Default is `ctrl+b` üôè
* You will be using it *A LOT*
* A good time to disable the scroll bar

## A few commands

* `prefix+k` = Kill the current window
* `prefix+n`, `c`, `0-9` & `w` = Nagivate between windows
* `prefix+d` = Detach from a session

* `prefix+z` = Zoom in & out of panes
* `prefix+arrows` = Move between panes in a window

## My keybindings
